# 🚀 Version-Controlled DevOps Workflow

## 🧭 Overview
This project demonstrates a **complete Git-based DevOps workflow** that mirrors how professional development teams manage, collaborate, and release code.  
It covers the entire lifecycle — repository creation, branching, merging, tagging, documentation, and release management — all using **Git** and **GitHub**.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
```

.
├── src/                  # Source files or demo scripts
├── docs/                 # Documentation and screenshots
├── README.md             # Project overview (this file)
├── TASK_LOG.md           # Chronological record of work
└── .gitignore            # Ignored files configuration

```

## 🌳 Branching Model
| Branch | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| `main` | Stable production-ready branch |
| `dev` | Integration branch for testing and feature merges |
| `feature/*` | Temporary branches for developing individual features |

**Workflow:**
```

feature/*  ➜  dev  ➜  main

````

---

## 🧩 Steps Followed
1. Initialized local Git repository.  
2. Created and connected GitHub remote.  
3. Set up `main`, `dev`, and `feature` branches.  
4. Added `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and `TASK_LOG.md`.  
5. Used feature branches and Pull Requests to merge into `dev`.  
6. Merged `dev` → `main` for stable release.  
7. Created annotated release tag `v1.0.0`.  
8. Added documentation and screenshots.
